# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

## PreParation
Create the following two scripts:
- Backend-flask/buildspec.yml, change the env variables to your owns
- aws/policies/ecr-codebuild-backend-role.json

Create a branch named prod, which will be used for AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline later.

At AWS ECS, update desired tasks in the service to 1, if this was set to 0 before.

Before this week, if our backend is updated and needed to be deployed into production, we need to run 
- ./bin/backend/build, 
- ./bin/backend/push, 
- ./bin/backend/deploy. With the following setup, this can be done in a CI/CD fashion.

## AWS CodePipeline

Create a pipeline:
 #### Step1:
 - Login to your AWS console and select codepipeline.
 - Name it as `cruddur-backend-fargate` and new service role it automatically fill the role `AWSCodePipelineServiceRole-us-east-1-cruddur-backend-fargate`
 In the advanced setting select the `Default location` and `Default AWS Managed key`

 - click on next
 ### Step2:Add Source stage
 - Add the Source stage. Select the source provider as `GitHub(Version 2.0)` from the up-down list. click on `Connect to Github`set connection name as cruddur, 
   install a new app, select the cruddur repo, in the end finish "Connect to GitHub" and back to the pipeline page.
   select the cruddur repo and select branch `prod`, select `start the pipeline on source code change` and default output artifact format as `Codepipeline default`

 ### Step3: Skip this step for now we will build it later.
 ### Step4: 
 - For deploy stage, select deploy provide as `Amazon ECS`, choose cluster name as `cruddur`,service name as `backend-flask`
