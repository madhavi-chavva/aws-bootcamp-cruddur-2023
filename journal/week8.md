# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing
## New Directory

Lets contain our cdk pipeline in a new top level directory called:

```sh
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir thumbing-serverless-cdk
```

## Install CDK globally

This is so we can use the AWS CDK CLI for anywhere.

```sh
npm install aws-cdk -g
```

We'll add the the install to our gitpod task file
```sh
  - name: cdk
    before: |
      npm install aws-cdk -g
```


## Initialize a new project

We'll initialize a new cdk project within the folder we created:

```sh
cdk init app --language typescript
```

## Add an S3 Bucket

Add the following code to your `thumbing-serverless-cdk-stack.ts`

```ts
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

const bucketName: string = process.env.THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME as string;

const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'ThumbingBucket', {
  bucketName: bucketName,
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});
```

```sh
export THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME="cruddur-thumbs"
gp env THUMBING_BUCKET_NAME="cruddur-thumbs"
```

- [Removal Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_core.RemovalPolicy.html)

## Bootstrapping

> Deploying stacks with the AWS CDK requires dedicated Amazon S3 buckets and other containers to be available to AWS CloudFormation during deployment. 

```sh
cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"
```

## Build

We can use build to catch errors prematurely.
This jsut builds tyescript

```sh
npm run build
```


## Synth

> the synth command is used to synthesize the AWS CloudFormation stack(s) that represent your infrastructure as code.

```sh
cdk synth
```


## Deploy

```sh
cdk deploy
```

## List Stacks

```sh
cdk ls
```
